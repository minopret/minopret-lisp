<ul>
<li>hex.lisp - support for arithmetic in several number bases (balanced-3, 10, 16, balanced-81), doing most computation in balanced ternary and expecting much I/O to be hexadecimal</li>
<li>lib.lisp - a few library functions that are generally useful</li>
<li>lispy1.py - evaluating Lisp trees using Python with very few builtin Lisp functions</li>
<li>parse3.py - reading Lisp s-expressions into nested Python lists with hardly any special syntax (only quote abbreviation)</li>
<li>repyl1.py - read-evaluate-print program for lispy1.py</li>
<li>test_bal3_mult_trit_acc.lisp - automated unit test in Lisp for the heart of the multiplication functionality in hex.lisp</li>
<li>test_hex.lisp - automated unit test in Lisp for hex.lisp</li>
<li>TODO - a list of various efforts that I might build on top of this Lisp</li>
<li>utf81.lisp - a systematic coding of Unicode points into balanced base-81 digits on the same principles as UTF-8; some support for translating between ASCII characters and their Unicode points (so far no solution is implemented for characters that are special to the Lisp parser parse3.py)</li>
</ul>
<p>Other approaches, other directions</p>
<ul>
<li>hex.v - proving algebraic models for boolean predicates, decidable propositions, Church numerals, and base-2 and base-16 numerals</li>
<li>lisp3.py - an approach to interpreting Lisp in Python based on Paul Graham's simple metacircular evaluator. I think I did something rather nice in defining Python classes Expr, Symbol, and List and in coding the initial environment for 'eval' using objects and methods of those classes. However, this Lisp currently fails on non-primitive builtins as 'assoc' has circular recursion. See test_lisp3.py and test_lisp3_cons_print.py for some examples of what works.</li>
<li>list.v - logical definitions of symbols for Lisp builtins and the "cons" structure using the algebraic data types of hex.v</li>
<li>minopret.lisp - a simple paraphrase of Paul Graham's metacircular evaluator for Lisp I</li>
<li>minopret_lisp.py - See test_minopret_lisp.py for some examples of what works and what doesn't.</li>
<li>minopret_lisp.v</li>
<li>m.lisp - a hand-coded environment for Lisp 'eval' containing definitions for Lisp I builtins</li>
<li>parse.py</li>
<li>README.md - an explanation of Git repository contents written when I thought rep3.py was ready for use</li>
<li>rep3.py</li>
<li>test_lisp3_cons_print.py - Some examples of what works in lisp3.py</li>
<li>test_lisp3.py - Some examples of what works in lisp3.py</li>
<li>test_minopret_lisp.py - examples of what works and what doesn't in minopret_lisp.py</li>
<li>test_parse3.py</li>
<li>yalisp.v - Example of coding Lisp syntax trees in Coq by automatically parsing and translating minopret.lisp via ?????.py, representing the syntax trees via definitions in list.v</li>
